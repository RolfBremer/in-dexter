# typst-index
Automatically create a handcrafted index in typst.
This typst component allows the automatic creation of an Index page with entries
that have been manually marked in the document by its authors. This, in times
of advanced search functionality, seems somewhat outdated, but a handcrafted index
like this allows the authors to point the reader to just the right location in the 
document.


## Importing the Component

To use the index functionality, the component must be available. This 
can be achived by copying the file `index.typ` into the project. It then must be 
imported into the file that uses it. The easiest way is to do an 

```typ
#import "index.typ": *
```

in the head of the document file(s) that want to use the index.

## Marking Entries

To mark a word to be included in the index, a simple function can be used. In the 
following sample code, the word "elit" is marked to be included into the index.

```typ
= Sample Text
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing #index[elit], sed do eiusmod tempor 
incididunt ut labore et dolore.
```

The marking, by default, is invisible in the resulting text, while the marked word 
will still be visible. With the marking in place, the index component knows about 
the word, as well as its location in the document.

## Generating the Index Page

The index page can be generated by the following function:

```typ
= Index
#columns(3)[
  #indOutline(title: none)
]
```

This sample emits the index in three columns.
